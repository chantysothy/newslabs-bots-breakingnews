whether they were working alone or whether there could be more of the same on the way. </paragraph><paragraph>At the same time, while they are treating this as a terrorist incident, they will know full well that they will have to test the evidence to ensure that this theory is correct. </paragraph><image id=\"95273935\"/><paragraph>MPs said they had heard three or four gunshots and staff inside Parliament were told to stay inside their offices. </paragraph><paragraph>Commons Leader David Lidington told MPs the \"alleged assailant was shot by armed police\".</paragraph><paragraph>Shortly after the incident, a Downing Street source confirmed that Mrs May was safe. </paragraph><paragraph>The prime minister was seen being ushered into a silver Jaguar car as what sounded like gunfire rang out at Parliament during the incident.</paragraph><paragraph>The White House said later that Mrs May had spoken to President Donald Trump about the attack.</paragraph><crosshead>'Screams and commotion'</crosshead><paragraph>Parliament was put into lockdown shortly after the incident at about 14:40 GMT. </paragraph><paragraph>Tom Peck, political editor for the Independent, tweeted: \"There was a loud bang.
