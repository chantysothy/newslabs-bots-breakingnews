After the explosion, witnesses spoke about the fear and confusion that gripped those caught up in the events.

Those inside the arena described clothing and mobile phones strewn across the floor as people scrambled for the exits.

Andy Holey, who had gone to the arena to pick up his wife and daughter who had been at the concert, said: "An explosion went off and it threw me about 

30ft from one set of doors to the other set of doors. 

"When I got up I saw bodies lying on the ground. My first thought was to go into the arena to try to find my family. 

"I managed to find them eventually and they're OK."

Emma Johnson said she and her husband were at the arena to pick up her children, aged 15 and 17.

"We were stood at the top of the stairs and the glass exploded - it was near to where they were selling the merchandise," she told BBC Radio Manchester.

"The whole building shook. There was a blast and then a flash of fire afterwards. There were bodies everywhere."
